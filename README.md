(OUDATED AS OF AUGUST 2, 2021! The WeAreDevs API has breaking changes which affected this template. The template will be fixed soon. For those of you desparate for a solution now, simply redownload the WeAreDevs API and replace the old file in this project. Also remove all usage of SendCommand() as that function is no longer supported)

# Exploit-Template-with-WRDAPI
Quickstart for creating a Roblox exploit with the WeAreDevs API

*WeAreDevs_API.dll must always be in the same folder as your built .exe file. 

*You can find the build file in the "build-result" folder. Give the readme.txt file a look!

*When sharing with friends, I would build in x86 release mode.
